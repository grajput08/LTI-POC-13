## Grading Workflow Clarification

When a student submits an assignment via the LTI Launch URL, the grade will not immediately appear in the Student Gradebook. Instead, the message "Instructor has not posted this grade" will be displayed. The instructor must manually enter and submit the grade through the Instructor Grading section. Once the instructor submits the grade, it will be reflected in the Student Gradebook for the student to view.

For more details on the grading process, you can refer to the official documentation: [LTIJS Grading Guide](https://cvmcosta.me/ltijs/#/grading).

For further clarification, please see the attached image and video demonstrating the process.
